    <p>   The charts below depict the growth rate in the economic sectors in America. It is clear, in both charts, that the services sector of the American economy has the most growth, both in terms of employment and gross value added. The services sector is an extremely vital portion of the American economy, which may be severely impacted by the current COVID-19 outbreak the world is dealing with today. These data points display three separate years, 2005, 2010 and 2019. The trend among values has not differed exponentially in these years which will allow us to clearly see the direct impact the Coronavirus has had on Americaâ€™s economy once they are released. The service industry is clearly a large amount of the economy and has also been hit the hardest due to the spread of the virus. Therefore, you will most likely see a drop in gross value added as well as percentage of employees that were effecting in both the services sector as well as industry and agriculture.   </p>
